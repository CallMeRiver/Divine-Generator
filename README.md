Divine Headcanon Generator was created to make assumptions about a character's name. By entering a name and clicking "Generate", the website will include said name into a sentence of something this character/person could do. This is the first HTML script I have ever created. Keep in mind that some prompts may seem repetitive, as there are several categories on prompts and some are larger than the others.
